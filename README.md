[Project Board](https://trello.com/b/s2y8nm41/travel-tracker) | [Project Wireframe](https://excalidraw.com/)

## Overview
Adventure awaits, but the lists keep on growing,<br>
So we invented this app to help track where you're going!<br>
There are spots that will show all the places you've been,<br>
all the places to come, and how much you've spent.<br>
Once you're ready to start on a brand new adventure,<br>
There's a form to submit and a cost that will render.<br>
So don't hesitate, there's a whole world to know!<br>
(Just please don't forget to keep track 'fore you go).

## Project Context
I am currently studying Front End Developement at the [Turing School of Software and Design](https://frontend.turing.edu/). This Travel Tracker app is the final solo project for Mod 2, meaning I have been a software developer for just under three months!

Goals for this project included:
- Using OOP to drive the design of the application and the code
- Working with an API to send and receive data
- Solidifying the code review process
- Creating a robust test suite that thoroughly tests all functionality of a client-side application

## Login Credentials
You will first be greeted by a login page. To access the traveler's dashboard, enter the following credentials:

Username: traveler[Number between 1 and 50]<br>
Password: travel

Note: Both are case-sensitive, and changing the number in the username will access a different user's profile.
